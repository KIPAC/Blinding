# Blinding

Do cosmological inferences need to be done blindly, in order to avoid unconscious concordance bias? And if so, how are we going to achieve this?

This repository will host KIPAC's discussion of cosmological blind analysis as it proceeds. This is research in progress: please get in touch [via the issues](https://github.com/KIPAC/Blinding/issues) to take part in the conversation.
